            <h2>Introduction of Riya Nandan</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Riya Nandan, a Class 10 student at Delhi Model Public School. This project represents a significant academic exercise where Iâ€™ve been given the opportunity to delve into the foundational aspects of web development. Utilizing HTML and CSS, I have crafted a structured and aesthetically balanced website that, while modest in scope, serves as a testament to my growing understanding of digital design principles.</p>
            <p>In creating this project, my goal was to not only fulfill the academic requirements but also to push the boundaries of my technical skills. This website stands as an example of my ability to combine creativity with functionality, ensuring that each element serves a purpose while contributing to an overall cohesive design. The process has allowed me to refine my problem-solving abilities, as I navigated the challenges of translating conceptual ideas into a working digital format.</p>
            <p>This project is a reflection of my commitment to excellence and my passion for learning. It showcases my dedication to mastering new skills and my eagerness to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context. I hope that this work not only meets but exceeds the expectations, demonstrating my capability and enthusiasm for the subject matter.</p>
